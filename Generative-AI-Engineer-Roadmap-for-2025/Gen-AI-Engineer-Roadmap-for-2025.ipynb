    "\n",
    "2. **Researching New Architectures**:\n",
    "   - **Advancing Model Architectures**: Generative AI Engineers continuously research new model architectures, such as transformers, GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), VAEs (Variational Autoencoders), and diffusion models. They explore hybrid models and novel techniques for generating higher-quality and more realistic outputs.\n",
    "   - **Optimizing Existing Models**: Engineers refine models for efficiency, scalability, and deployment, ensuring generative models can work in real-time applications or on edge devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fine-tuning Pre-trained Models**:\n",
